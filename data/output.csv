Radiology  *   Definition: Radiology is a medical specialty that uses imaging technologies to diagnose and treat diseases. It involves the interpretation of images, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds, to identify abnormalities and guide medical interventions. The application of AI in radiology aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve workflow efficiency, and personalize patient care. *   Relevance: AI is rapidly transforming radiology by automating image analysis, improving diagnostic precision, and enabling faster and more efficient workflows. This leads to better patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and improved accessibility to specialized diagnostic services. ;1.
