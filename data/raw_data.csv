Sr no;Domain;Potential use cases
1;Medical;Speeding up image acquisition in MR- Magnetic resonance (MR) is another imaging modality that plays an ever-more important role in precision diagnosis of medical conditions. The rising use of MR is increasing the pressure to efficiently scan more patients and to shorten the path from initial scan to final diagnosis. At the same time, MR departments are looking for ways to improve satisfaction of patients and referring physicians.
2;Radiology;Helping radiologists read images faster and more accurately- Similarly, AI can support with image segmentation and quantification in radiology, thereby enabling radiologists to focus on higher-level interpretation of images. AI can also act as a second set of eyes, serving as an adjunct to the radiologist’s decision-making by pointing them to areas of interest or incidental findings they may have overlooked.
3;Oncology;Supporting multidisciplinary collaboration in cancer care- Beyond analyzing single sources of data, there are also examples of AI in healthcare that show it can help connect previously disconnected and disparate patient data – providing novel insights that support healthcare professionals in their decision-making.
4;Medical;Speeding up image acquisition in MR : Enter AI-based image reconstruction, which can accelerate MR exams to increase department productivity and reduce the cost per exam, while supporting diagnostic confidence with high-resolution images. On top of that, the technology increases MR accessibility for patients who are stressed, anxious or in pain. Because it shortens exams and provides first-time-right scans regardless of patient condition, patients spend less time in the scanner, thereby improving their experience.
5;Medical; Taking the complexity out of ultrasound measurements- In cardiac care, ultrasound has developed into an indispensable tool to help visualize and evaluate a patient’s heart function. In fact, it is now often the first imaging modality used to diagnose patients [2]. However, the challenge with ultrasound is that it strongly relies on the person operating the system. Certain measurements, which are needed for every echo exam, can be time-consuming and have high inter- and intra-user variability.
6;Mechanical;Supporting multidisciplinary collaboration in cancer care- In cancer care, for example, AI can help integrate information across different clinical domains such as radiology, pathology, EHR systems, and genomics – providing a clear, intuitive view of the patient’s disease state. This can assist multidisciplinary tumor boards in making timely, informed treatment decisions, to give every patient the best chance of a positive treatment outcome.
7;Radiology;Helping radiologists read images faster and more accurately- For example, AI algorithms that scour MR images of the brain for subtle neurological changes over time have been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy in multiple sclerosis patients by 44%, while reducing reading times [3]. Similarly, AI-based lung nodule detection can perform nodule search 26% faster, detecting 29% of previously missed nodules compared to manual inspection [4]. For time-pressured radiologists who have to interpret more images than ever before, such AI-enabled support can make a meaningful difference, while also benefiting the patient
8;Oncology;Supporting multidisciplinary collaboration in cancer care- In the future, the intelligent integration of data could give further insight into a patient’s prognosis, supporting selection of the best care pathway for that particular patient based on an analysis of treatment outcomes for similar patients
9;Technology;"Taking the complexity out of ultrasound measurements- With AI, we can take away some of that manual and repetitive labor; just like in some of the other AI in healthcare examples in this overview. AI-based automatic measurements can deliver fast and reproducible echo quantification, improving both the patient and staff experience. Healthcare professionals can accept or modify measurements based on their own clinical assessments, giving them a powerful tool to enhance their expertise while remaining in control of diagnostic decision-making."
10;Medical;Guiding physicians during minimally invasive surgical procedures- Interventional physicians, who perform minimally invasive procedures on patients with heart disease and other conditions, are another group to gain from AI-based workflow automation and clinical decision support.
11;Medical;Guiding physicians during minimally invasive surgical procedures- For example, in stroke care, cloud-based AI can help analyze CT images to automatically detect large vessel occlusion – a major source of stroke – as well as its location. The software then shares this analysis with physicians at the primary stroke center and at the intervention center where the patient is eventually treated. Similarly, cloud-based AI can aid in planning and guiding endovascular surgery, helping interventional physicians to operate more accurately and efficiently.
