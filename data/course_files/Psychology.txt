    *   Types of Data:
        *   Psychological Survey Data: Responses from questionnaires and surveys measuring psychological traits and states.
        *   EEG Signals: Electrical activity of the brain recorded via electroencephalography.
        *   Facial Expression Analysis: Images and videos of facial expressions used to infer emotional states.
        *   Text Data: Transcripts of therapy sessions, social media posts, and written journals.
        *   Behavioral Data: Data collected from observing behavior in controlled experiments or naturalistic settings.
    *   Significance for AI Applications:
        *   Survey data enables the development of predictive models for mental health outcomes.
        *   EEG signals provide insights into brain activity related to cognitive and emotional processes.
        *   Facial expression analysis allows for automated emotion recognition.
        *   Text data can be analyzed using NLP techniques to identify patterns in language indicative of psychological distress.
        *   Behavioral data is crucial for training AI models to understand and predict human behavior.
*   **1.4 Implications of Using AI**
    *   Ethical Implications: Concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for misdiagnosis or inappropriate interventions.
    *   Legal Implications: Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and ensuring transparency and accountability in AI-driven psychological assessments and treatments.
    *   Social Implications: Potential changes in the role of psychologists, the need for training in AI literacy, and the impact of AI on the accessibility and affordability of mental health services.
    *   Examples:
        *   Positive: Enhanced access to mental health support through AI-powered chatbots.
        *   Negative: Algorithmic bias leading to unfair or discriminatory treatment recommendations.
*   **1.5 Additional Learning Resources**
