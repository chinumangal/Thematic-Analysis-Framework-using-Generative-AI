        3.2 Assessment:
        --Plan how to evaluate learners' achievement of learning outcomes:
        --Choose appropriate assessment methods (e.g., exams, projects, presentations).
        --Consider incorporating real-world applications and problem-solving tasks.
        --Ensure assessments are fair and account for learners' diverse backgrounds.
        3.3 Learning Activities:
        --Design engaging and effective learning experiences:
        --Incorporate the Merrill principles of instruction:
        --Problem-Centered: Engage learners with real-world problems.
        --Activation: Build on learners' prior knowledge.
        --Demonstration: Show examples of AI applications in the domain.
        --Application: Provide opportunities for learners to apply new knowledge.
        --Integration: Encourage learners to integrate new skills into their work.
        --Use a mix of teaching methods: Lectures, labs, discussions, and group work should be utilized to engage learners effectively.



    **Instructions:**
        1. Use concise and structured content generation, do not change the section headings name.
        2. Design the course outline very carefully, including all the components in the template. 
        3. Double-check the course outline that you generate. Based on these measures Correctness (Accuracy), Coherence, Relevance, Completeness, Originality, Instructive.

Next, you will be provided with details and instructions regarding the domain and course for which you will create the outline. 
Give me a Chain of thought of what logical steps you will perform.
