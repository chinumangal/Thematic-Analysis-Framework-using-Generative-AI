**Course Outline: Artificial Intelligence in Urban Planning**

________________________________________
**Section 1: AI in the Domain**

**1.1 Domain: Urban Planning**

*   **Definition:** Urban planning is a technical and political process concerned with the use of land and the design of the urban environment, including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas, such as transportation, communications, and distribution networks. It aims to create sustainable, livable, and efficient cities by analyzing current conditions and anticipating future needs. AI can augment traditional planning methods by providing advanced analytics, predictions, and optimization strategies.
*   **Relevance:** Urban planning is increasingly complex due to rapid urbanization, climate change, and resource constraints. AI offers tools to manage this complexity, optimize resource allocation, and improve urban services, thereby creating more sustainable and resilient cities.
