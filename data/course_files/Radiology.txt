*   **Legal Implications:** Liability concerns in cases of misdiagnosis by AI, compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., HIPAA), and the need for regulatory frameworks for AI-based medical devices.
*   **Social Implications:** Changes in the role of radiologists, the potential for job displacement, and the need for retraining and upskilling. Accessibility of advanced diagnostics in remote and underserved areas.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Positive:** Faster and more accurate diagnoses, improved patient outcomes, reduced radiologist burnout, increased accessibility to specialized care.
    *   **Negative:** Algorithmic bias leading to health disparities, potential for job displacement among radiologists, over-reliance on AI leading to loss of clinical skills.
*   **Domain-Specific Concerns:**
    *   The need for explainable AI (XAI) to understand how AI algorithms arrive at their conclusions, the importance of high-quality training data, and the need for continuous monitoring and validation of AI systems.
