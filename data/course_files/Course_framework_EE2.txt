**1.1 Domain:** Mechanical Engineering Design
*   **Definition:** Mechanical engineering design involves the process of creating and improving mechanical systems, devices, and products by applying principles of physics, materials science, and engineering. It encompasses conceptualization, analysis, simulation, prototyping, and optimization of mechanical components and systems. The integration of AI is aimed at streamlining these processes, enhancing design efficiency, and enabling innovative solutions.
*   **Relevance:** AI is transforming mechanical engineering design by automating repetitive tasks, optimizing complex designs, predicting system performance, and enabling the exploration of a wider range of design alternatives in a shorter timeframe. This leads to faster product development cycles, improved product quality, and greater innovation.

**1.2 Potential AI Use Cases:**
