Okay, I understand. Here's my chain of thought for creating the detailed course outline based on the provided framework:

**1. Understand the Task and Framework:**

*   I will start by carefully reviewing the provided framework, paying close attention to the structure of each section (1, 2, and 3) and its subsections.
*   I will understand the specific requirements for each subsection, such as defining the domain, identifying AI use cases, and outlining assessment strategies.
*   I will ensure that I understand the Merrill principles of instruction and how to integrate them into learning activities.

**2. Await Domain and Course Details:**

*   I will wait for the specific domain and any further course instructions to be provided. This is crucial as the entire course outline is dependent on these details.
*   I will need to know the specific field (e.g., radiology, finance, education) to tailor the content appropriately.
*   I will be attentive to any specific learning objectives or constraints mentioned.

**3. Fill Section 1: AI in the Domain:**

*   **1.1 Domain:** Based on the domain provided, I will define it clearly and concisely, explaining its key aspects and relevance.
*   **1.2 Potential AI Use Cases:** I will research and identify current and potential AI applications within the given domain. I'll describe how AI is transforming or could transform the field and explain specific problems that AI can address.
*   **1.3 Data in the Domain:** I will specify the types of data used within the domain, emphasize its importance for AI, and explain how the understanding of this data enables the application of the right AI techniques.
*   **1.4 Implications of Using AI:** I will discuss the ethical, legal, and social consequences of AI use in the domain, including both positive and negative impacts, and any unique considerations.
*   **1.5 Additional Learning Resources:** I will compile a list of relevant resources, including textbooks, OER, online courses, articles, etc., that students can use to deepen their understanding.

**4. Fill Section 2: Learning Environment:**

*   **2.1 Learners and Their Interaction with AI:** Based on the expected learner profile (provided or inferred from the domain), I will describe the target learners, their current knowledge of AI, their domain background, and the expected role they'll have with AI after the course (e.g., user, developer, decision-maker).
*   **2.2 Instructors:** I will outline the required qualifications for instructors, including their AI skills, domain expertise, and teaching experience.
*   **2.3 Internal Support:** I will consider the available resources, including budget, personnel, data, software, hardware, and institutional support, and the constraints that these resources impose.

**5. Fill Section 3: Course Implementation:**

*   **3.1 Learning Outcomes:** I will define clear, measurable learning outcomes, specifying what learners should know or be able to do by the end of the course, aligning them with the identified AI use cases and data types in the domain.
*   **3.2 Assessment:** I will plan how to assess learners' achievement of the learning outcomes, including different assessment methods (e.g., exams, projects, presentations), focusing on real-world problem solving and ensuring fair assessments.
*   **3.3 Learning Activities:** I will design engaging learning activities that incorporate Merrill's principles of instruction (problem-centered, activation, demonstration, application, and integration) using a mix of lectures, labs, discussions, and group work. I will focus on activities that facilitate understanding and practical application of concepts.

**6. Review and Refine:**

*   I will carefully review the entire course outline for correctness, coherence, relevance, completeness, originality, and instructiveness.
*   I will make any necessary adjustments to ensure a well-structured, comprehensive, and engaging learning experience.

I'm ready for the domain and course details. Let me know when you're ready to provide them.
