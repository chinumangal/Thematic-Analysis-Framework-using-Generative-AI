        *   Valid Test Data: Data that should be accepted by the software.
        *   Invalid Test Data: Data that should be rejected by the software.
        *   Boundary Test Data: Data at the limits of valid input ranges.
        *   Absent Test Data: Scenarios where data is missing or incomplete.
        *   Log Data: System and application logs providing insights into software behavior.
    *   Significance for AI Applications:
        *   Structured data enables precise algorithm training and analytics for test case generation and defect prediction.
        *   Valid and invalid test data helps train AI models to identify edge cases and vulnerabilities.
        *   Log data allows for anomaly detection and root cause analysis using machine learning techniques.

1.4 Implications of Using AI:**
    *   Ethical Implications: Ensuring fairness and avoiding bias in AI-driven testing tools, transparency in AI decision-making.
