 # Thematic Analysis with Generative AI

As the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across various domains accelerates , it is important that AI education is thoughtfully structured and standardized. This tool is developed to analyze the AI Course Design Planning Frameworks dataset. This framework provides structure for the development of domain-speciﬁc AI courses at the university level. In this tool we use Generative AI (Gemini) to automate thematic analysis. It extracts meaningful keywords, clusters data by domain, and visualizes thematic insights to support AI curriculum design and filtering.

 
## Introduction 

### What is Thematic Analysis?
During a research, we need to analyze either quantitative or qualitative data. Quantitative data, i.e., numerical data can be analyzed by various mathematical ways. Qualitative data can 
take many forms, including text, audio, video, and images. One could obtain this data from interviews, survey responses, group discussions, etc. This type of data goes beyond numbers conveying 
context, emotions and subtleties behind human behaviour, interactions and experiences. 

**Thematic analysis** is a method used to identifying recurring ideas, topics, or categories  in non-numerical data. It is a fundamental methods in QDA can be employed in broad range of 
approaches (e.g., theoretical, conceptual, epistemological) effectively. 

Traditionally, thematic analysis can be performed manually for small volumes of data. However, for large volumes of data, approaches like machine learning techniques, including topic modeling, 
clustering, and deep learning are more effective. In this project we will take a look at how we can use Generative AI models for Thematic analysis.  

### AI Course Design Planning Framework
The AI Course Design Planning Framework, is a course planning framework to structure the development of domain-speciﬁc AI courses at the university level [1]. The framework has series of 
questions focusing application of AI in the domain, learning environment, course implementation and outcome. This framework bridges the gap between AI capabilities and domain-specific demands,
enabling impactful and practical AI education. While answering these questions, it could be helpful for educators if they could view all the related frameworks with a simple search query. Also,
use cases from one domain could spark new ideas for a different domain. 

Our project is inspired by the research work that highlights the need for **customized AI courses across different domains**. Each domain has it's unique learning goals, datasets, challenges 
and regulatory constraints. Designing AI courses using **domain-specific insights** ensures they’re more relevant and effective. 

To do this, we need to analyze the theme in each framework and extract keywords to be used for filtering through the data. With this project, we aim to streamline the thematic analysis process by integrating Generative AI, further enabling the automatic identification of key themes, generation of relevant keywords, and efficient filtering of data. The proposed framework addresses the challenges of managing large datasets and extracting actionable insights for educators, researchers, and stakeholders.


## Problem Statement and Research questions

_**Perform thematic analysis to generate insights from qualitative data (AI Course Design planning framework) using Generative AI (GenAI)**_

This involves both understanding how to extract themes and how to make them actionable—by enabling interactive exploration or filtering. So we framed our investigation around three key 
research questions:

* How can Generative AI be applied to extract meaningful themes and keywords from a course design framework?
* How effectively can these keywords be used to support filtering and querying?
* How can AI-driven visualizations like spider charts and pie charts enhance interpretability?


## Methodology

Input: AI Course Design Planning Framework or Course criteria

Intermediate steps:
- Simulate and preprocess course frameworks with Gemini
- Perform thematic analysis to extract keywords
- Generate embeddings and set up filtering framework
- Group themes and visualize them in the form pie chart, stacked charts, etc.

Outut: Streamlit app 

The process is visualized as seen here.

## Sample Results

This tool was able to cluster the frameworks according to the domain, and further extract valuable insights related to use cases, learners, instructors and learning outcomes. For example, 
user can see that use case like Predictive maintenance is more relevant in Engineering and Technology domain than Design and creative arts. User can further know about positive and negative
implications of using AI in Medical domain. Semantic search, enabled with embeddings, helps user to search similar frameworks for reference or while creating new frameworks. Additionally, 
the user can compare different domains and how they could benefit from each other when it comes to applying AI.
